The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 19, Saturday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 20180519-Sat
Finally start work on my own projects. Next to the occasional jam, this should help me be more productive and broaden my experience. Also to be used as sandbox environment to try out new ideas.

Setup skeleton with cmake under msys2.

### R1D2
Added two skeleton modules, plus made a small planning for the project.
